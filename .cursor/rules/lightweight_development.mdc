# Lightweight Development Rule

When implementing new features or components:

- Prioritize simplicity and minimal dependencies
- Use lightweight libraries and frameworks when possible
- Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering
- Ensure code is maintainable and readable
- Focus on meeting functional requirements efficiently
- Choose minimal but effective solutions
- Prefer built-in language features over third-party libraries when reasonable
- Keep the codebase lean and focused on core functionality
