  - Backend: Flask
  - Frontend: Vue.js with Tailwind CSS (as determined)
  - Database: SQLite
  - Deployment: Electron Application or Docker (as determined)
- Follow the database schema design outlined in the project document
- Ensure implementation follows the phased approach in the roadmap
- Make sure constraint programming concepts are correctly implemented
